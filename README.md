# Welcome-to-Carver-House
Procedurally generated exploration game, lovecraftian setting and themes.

No one has seen the Crackpot of Carver House for some time. Normally that just fine with the villagers, who have long gone out of their way to avoid both Evelyn Carver AND her haunted manse with its ghostly portraits of long-dead ancestors lining the halls. Rumor has it that visitors vanish ... and a new portrait joins the eerie procession. Is that the reason Evelyn Carver obsessively adds onto her house, which has become an endless labyrinth of rooms?

But lately, a developer has been sniffing around the valuable estate even though it is emphatically not for sale. And the village Inspector has overheard whispering among a gang of young ruffians, emboldened by visions of old money hidden in crevices unguarded by anything but an elderly woman.

Why, the Inspector wonders, have no lamps flared in the windows of Carver House for over a fortnight? Perturbed, she pays a visit after hours. No one answers her knock but the unlatched door opens at a touch.
The Inspector gingerly takes a few steps into the foyer.

With a barely perceptible click, the door vanishes even as she whirls to grab the doorknob.

Rattled but undaunted, the Inspector strides across the room and embarks on a quest to find the mansion's inhabitant ... and a way out.

She finds a necklace.
She finds a candlestick.
She finds a bloody handkerchief.
She finds a will.
And finally, a key.

Satisfied that she has enough evidence to put together a case, the Inspector unlocks the exit and heads to the police station.
